        🌐 Frontend Development
My journey in development began with a fascination for creating interactive and intuitive user interfaces. I specialize in modern frontend technologies such as:

HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+)

React.js, Angular, and Vue.js

Responsive design with Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and custom CSS

State management tools like Redux and Context API

Integration of RESTful APIs and third-party services

With a keen eye for detail and UX, I focus on performance, accessibility, and pixel-perfect implementation to ensure that users enjoy a seamless experience across all devices and browsers.

⚙️ Backend Development
On the backend, I build secure, scalable, and maintainable applications using:

Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Hibernate

RESTful API development and microservice architecture

MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB for data management

Authentication & authorization with JWT, OAuth2

Unit and integration testing using JUnit and Mockito

I emphasize clean code practices, proper documentation, and design patterns to create services that are both efficient and easy to scale.

🔄 Full Stack Integration
As a full stack developer, I’m experienced in connecting all the moving parts of an application — from responsive UIs to powerful APIs and databases. I use tools and platforms such as:

Maven, Gradle for project management

Git/GitHub for version control and collaboration

CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions

Docker for containerization and smooth deployment
